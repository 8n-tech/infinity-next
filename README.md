**Infinity Next** is an imageboard using the [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). It was conceived as a way to replace what [8chan](https://8ch.net) runs on. Its current codebase has aged poorly and I felt the world was ready for a redo.

# License

While not binding, I do ask that users link back to this git repository or to https://infinitydev.org on their website. Sharing is caring. â™¥

# Requirements
Larachan runs on Laravel 5 and has the same requirements.

* `PHP 5.4` or greater.
  * `php5-mycrypt` for bcrypt functions.
  * `php5-curl` for Stripe.
  * `php5-gd` for captcha codes and other image manipulation.

# Contributing
Everyone is welcome to contribute, but please follow repository etiquette.

* Fork the repository.
* Raise an issue for everything you fix.
* Tie your commits to issues.
* Keep pull requests concise, list issues addressed, and make it easy to pull them.

## Coding Standards
In the name of preventing conflict and keeping the codebase clean, I am implementing the **[exact same standards of Laravel contributors](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/contributions#coding-style)**.

> Laravel follows the [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) and [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) coding standards. In addition to these standards, the following coding standards should be followed:
>
> * The class namespace declaration must be on the same line as `<?php`.
> * A class's opening `{` must be on the same line as the class name.
> * Functions and control structures must use Allman style braces.
> Indent with tabs, align with spaces.

"Allman style braces" refer to having a curly-brace on a new line at the same level of indentation as the conditional itself.

```
if (condition)
{
	// Code here.
}
```
